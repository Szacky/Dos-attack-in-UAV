# Drone DoS Attack Simulator

This repository contains a Python script for simulating a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack on a drone via UDP. The script sends continuous malicious packets to the drone’s communication port, flooding it with data and potentially disrupting the drone's functionality.

> **Disclaimer**: This script is intended for educational purposes only. It is illegal and unethical to use it for attacking or disrupting real systems or devices without permission. Always ensure you have explicit consent to perform security tests on any network or device.

## Features

- **DoS Attack Simulation**: The script simulates a flood of UDP packets to overwhelm the target drone and disrupt its operation.
- **Multithreading**: Utilizes multiple threads to send packets simultaneously, amplifying the attack's effectiveness.
- **Customizable Payload**: The payload is a hex-encoded message, which can be customized to target specific vulnerabilities or behaviors in the drone’s communication protocol.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of networking and DoS attack mechanics.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DroneDoSAttack.git
   cd DroneDoSAttack
